# Intro to Hardened JavaScript

::: tip Status: Work In Progress
:::

JavaScript is a remarkably expressive programming language, but
not all of the expressiveness is useful for building smart contracts.
Consider this `changePassword` function:

<<< @/snippets/test-no-ses.js#changePassword

In ordinary JavaScript, since someone might have redefined
the `includes` method on `Array` objects, we run the risk of password exfiltration:

<<< @/snippets/test-no-ses.js#exfiltrate

## Object Capability (OCap) Security and the Principle of Least Authority

In Hardened JavaScript, the `Object.assign` fails because
**all [standard, built-in objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)
are immutable**. Moreover, our first property of an _object capability_ system
is that **no IO access or shared mutable state is granted by any global object**.
Network IO via the `fetch` object is not available in the global
scope (nor by way of imported Hardened JavaScript modules);
likewise, random number IO with `Math.random` is not available
and `Date.now()` always returns `NaN`, preventing clock IO.

::: tip TODO: how to advise against / prohibit exported mutable state?
:::

JavaScript, including Hardened JavaScript, is memory-safe,
so we have our next object capability requirement: **object references cannot be forged**.
If object `bob` has no reference to object `concertTicket`,
the only way `bob` can obtain a reference to it
is if some object `alice` has references to both `bob` and `concertTicket`
and passes `concertTicket` to `bob` in a call such as `bob.receive(concertTicket)`.
We refer to these unforgeable object references as _object capabilities_.

![alice calls bob.receive(concertTicket)](../../assets/Introduction.svg)

::: tip Forging references in memory-unsafe languages
In C/C++, if `b` knows that object `c` of type `T` is at address `size_t c_addr = 0xDEADBEAF;` in memory,
`b` can _forge_ a reference to `c` by casting the number to a pointer: `T *c = (T*)c_addr;`.
In rust and go, forging references is allowed only in explicitly unsafe constructs, but it is possible.
:::

Finally, JavaScript provides encapsulation so that we have our
final object capability property: **access to (and modification of) internal state of
an objects is voluntary**, as expressed in its external methods.
One object cannot directly read or tamper with the contents of another.

As we will see, object capabilities facilitate
application of the [principle of least authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege)
and let us express powerful patterns of cooperation _without_ vulnerability.

Overview:
 - Objects
 - Defensive Correctness
 - **Electronic Rights**
 - Data Structures
 - Reference: JSON Data, Justin expressions, Jessie programs

## Getting Started: Tools

TL;DR: Here are the steps to play whack-a-mole with the Jessie linter:

1. If not already configured, run `yarn add eslint @jessie.js/eslint-plugin`
2. If not already configured, add the following to your `package.json`:

```json
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "@jessie.js"
    ]
  }
```

3. Put `// @jessie-check` at the beginning of your `.js` source file.
4. Run `yarn eslint --fix path/to/your-source.js`
5. Follow the linter's advice to edit your file, then go back to step 4.

## Simple Objects

Singleton, stateless:

```js
const origin = {
    getX: () => 0,
    getY: () => 0,
};
```

```console
> origin.getY()
0
```


## Object makers

```js
const makeCounter = init => {
  let value = init;
  return {
    increment: () => {
      value += 1;
      return value;
    },
    makeOffsetCounter: delta => makeCounter(value + delta),
  };
};
```

```console
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v14.16.0.
Type ".help" for more information
> const c1 = makeCounter(1);
> c1.increment();
2
> const c2 = c1.makeOffsetCounter(10);
> c1.increment();
3
> c2.increment();
13
> [c1.increment(), c2.increment()];
[ 4, 14 ]
```

 - An object is a record of functions that close over shared state.
 - The `this` keyword is not part of Jessie, so neither are constructors.
 - A `makeCounter` function takes the place of the `class Counter` constructor syntax.


_TODO: `decrement()`, facets_

## WARNING: Pervasive Mutability

```console
> c1.increment = () => { console.log('launch the missiles!'); }
[Function (anonymous)]
> c1.increment()
launch the missiles!
```


## Defensive objects with `harden()`

```js
const makeCounter = init => {
  let value = init;
  return harden({
    increment: () => {
      value += 1;
      return value;
    },
    makeOffsetCounter: delta => makeCounter(value + delta),
  });
};
```

```
> const c3 = Object.freeze(c1.makeOffsetCounter(10));
undefined
> c3.increment = () => { console.log('launch the missiles!'); }
TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'increment' of object '#<Object>'
> c3.increment()
15
```

 - _caveat_: exception is thrown in strict mode. REPL might not throw.
 - regardless, the object defended itself
 - Jessie pre-defines `harden` (_as does Agoric smart contract framework_)
   - see the `ses` [hardened Javascript package](https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses#harden) otherwise


## Types: advisory

```js
// @ts-check

/** @param {number} init */
const makeCounter = init => {
  let value = init;
  return {
    increment: () => {
      value += 1;
      return value;
    },
    /** @param {number} delta */
    makeOffsetCounter: delta => makeCounter(value + delta),
  };
};
```

## Types: advisory (cont.)

If we're not careful, our clients can cause us to mis-behave:

```
> const evil = makeCounter('poison')
> evil2.increment()
'poison1'
```

or worse:

```
> const evil2 = makeCounter({ valueOf: () => { console.log('launch the missiles!'); return 1; } });
> evil2.increment()
launch the missiles!
2
```

## Types: defensive

```js
/** @param {number | bignum} init */
const makeCounter = init => {
  let value = Nat(init);
  return harden({
    increment: () => {
      value += 1n;
      return value;
    },
    /** @param {number | bignum} delta */
    makeOffsetCounter: delta => makeCounter(value + Nat(delta)),
  });
};
```

```
> makeCounter('poison')
Uncaught TypeError: poison is a string but must be a bigint or a number
```

 - **defensive correctness**: a program is _defensively correct_ if it remains correct despite arbitrary behavior on the part of its clients.

## Details: Stay Tuned

 - Ordinary programming in JavaScript follows in a later section
 - Much overlap with Java, Python, C, etc.
