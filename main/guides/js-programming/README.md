# Agoric JavaScript Programming

Agoric's platform lets you write secure smart contracts in JavaScript. The platform 
itself is mainly written in JavaScript. However, we've made several Agoric-specific 
additions and deletions to general JavaScript programming that you should know about 
and understand before programming on the platform. Some are *concepts*, others 
are *Agoric library additions*, and some are at the *syntax level*. All changes at the 
language level are in process to become official standards.

- **[Secure EcmaScript (SES)](./ses/)**
  - SES provides a secure platform for
    executing programs. With SES, you can run code you don't completely trust,
    without being vulnerable to bugs or bad intentions. It's a
    standards-track extension to the JavaScript standard. Notable additions
    include the `lockdown()` and `harden()` methods to freeze objects. 
    
- **[`BigInt`](./bigint.md)** 
  - JavaScript's `Number` primitive only represents
    numbers up to 2<sup>53</sup> - 1. `BigInt` is a newer built-in JavaScript 
    object that represents arbitrarily large integers. Agoric uses `BigInts` for 
    `amount` `values` and times.

- **[Vats](./vats.md)**
  - Objects and functions in the same JavaScript vat can
    communicate synchronously. Communication with objects outside the
    vat can only be done asynchronously. 
    
- **[`Far()` and remotable objects](./far.md)**
  - In Agoric smart contracts and dapps, you can call methods on objects from other
    vats or machines. Objects intended to be used from other vats are called *remotables*. 
    To mark an object as remotable, use the `Far()` function.

- **[Remote object communication using `E`](./eventual-send.md)**
  - `E` is a local "bridge" function that lets
    you invoke methods on remote objects, whether in another vat, machine, or blockchain (for example).
    It takes a local representative (a *proxy*) for a remote object as an argument and sends messages
    to it using normal message-sending syntax. The local proxy forwards all messages to the remote 
    object to deal with. Sending a message to the remote object must be done by 
    using `E` (`E(remoteObj).myMethod()`).

- **[Notifiers and Subscriptions](./notifiers.md)**
  - The Agoric platform uses Notifiers and Subscriptions to distribute state change
    updates. Both deliver an asynchronous stream of messages as a publish-subscribe system
    might, without requiring explicit management of lists of subscribers. Notifiers are
    lossy conveyors of non-final values while Subscriptions are lossless value conveyors.
